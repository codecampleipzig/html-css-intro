## Make a big difference with a little software

Two trends are becoming increasingly apparent in the software development world.

- It is becoming easier by the day to build a software product.
- The number of people in search of ideas for those software products is
  increasing.

With the advent of no-code solutions and the hacker/maker movement, we, more
than ever, are recognizing the power of being able to idealize, build, and ship
a product that can impact more people than ever in history.

Having a CS degree or knowing a programming language is becoming less of a
factor in what you can accomplish with software, so it‚Äôs only natural that more
people want to try their hand in building something with these technologies.
Since you‚Äôre at it, why not consider a solution for somebody else‚Äôs problems?

When I published the [12 Great Ideas for Programming Projects That People Will Use](https://medium.com/better-programming/12-ideas-for-programming-projects-too-dangerous-not-to-build-514e3212ab77) article, I became even more convinced that people were clamoring for this type of quick start.
The feedback I received was incredible, and I knew I had to find another batch
of ideas at least as good as the ones in that article.

The search is over and here they are.

## 1. CSS Framework Comparator

When you have [30+ CSS frameworks](https://project-awesome.org/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks) in active development, it can be a pain to
distinguish them and pick one that most adapts to your needs. It‚Äôs not easy to
compare styles, to see how easily you can customize some rules, their impact on
performance, or even how approachable they are for a beginner.

I imagine a solution where a simple web app with the most common UI elements
could be restyled with a drop-down selection of a CSS framework. This would
easily let you compare the elements you might be interested in. In each section
of the design, we should also be able to compare the differences in the HTML.
You might like one style but not so much the code supporting it.

I love the example of [Happy Hues](https://www.happyhues.co/), which has a very similar purpose but for color
palettes. You get to compare them and see how they look like in the context of a
real landing page.
